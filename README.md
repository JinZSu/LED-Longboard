# LED-Longboard
	-LED attachment to LongBoard using Adafruit Accelerometer, Arduino Nano and WS2812B LED Strips

# Goal
	-I wanted to make an LED tracker that based on position and velocity. A longboard standing still will have the LED in place, but as long as the position moves just a little, the LED should move along with it
	-Still need to design cover on the longboard
	-Final Code and video upload soon
